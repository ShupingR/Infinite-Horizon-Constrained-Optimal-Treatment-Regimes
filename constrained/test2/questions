## CMDP:
###Finite-stage
Optimal policy depend on initial state in finite horizon???
Initial distribution.

Randomization? = Stochastic optimal policy? Or deterministic optimal policy exist??? Mixing?

Infinite state-action space needs Lyapunous function???

### Infinite-stage
Infinite stage? Stationary stochastic policy? Not depend on initial state? Uniform optimal policy ? Some initial states may have no feasible solution. Is it the case for infinite stage as well?

Coarser discretization for finite state space , find optimal policy for each initial state? Mixing? Randomization?

Deterministic is special case of stochastic policy 

Define my policy class as $P(A=a \mid \phi( X )) = p(\phi( x))$ (8)

## Existence of stationary policy under constraints

Discretization is applied here to make sure the optimal constrained exist, and will need to assess how close it is to the true optimal?

Why Mean? Continuous time?
